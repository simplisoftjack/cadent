  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 27, 2026</p>

  <p>These terms govern your use of the Cadent mobile application ("the app"). By creating an account or using the app, you agree to these terms.</p>

  <h2>What Cadent Does</h2>

  <p>Cadent is a personal fitness tracking app. It lets you log workouts, import activity data from Apple Health, set distance and frequency goals, and view your progress over time. The app is provided for personal, non-commercial use.</p>

  <h2>Your Account</h2>

  <p>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials. You may create one account per person. You must provide a valid email address when signing up.</p>

  <p>You can delete your account at any time from Settings. Deletion is permanent and removes all your data from our systems.</p>

  <h2>Your Data</h2>

  <p>You retain ownership of all data you create or import into Cadent. We do not claim any rights over your workout data, goals, or other personal information. See our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details on how we handle your data.</p>

  <h2>Acceptable Use</h2>

  <p>You agree not to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the app for any illegal purpose.</li>
    <li>Attempt to gain unauthorised access to other users' accounts or data.</li>
    <li>Interfere with or disrupt the app's infrastructure.</li>
    <li>Reverse-engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract the source code of the app.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Health Disclaimer</h2>

  <p>Cadent is a fitness tracking tool, not a medical device. The app does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Workout statistics such as heart rate, calories, and pace are based on data from your device and Apple Health — their accuracy depends on your hardware and settings. Always consult a qualified health professional before making decisions about your health or fitness routine.</p>

  <h2>Availability and Changes</h2>

  <p>We aim to keep Cadent available and reliable, but we do not guarantee uninterrupted service. We may update, modify, or discontinue features at any time. We will make reasonable efforts to preserve your data, but recommend using the Export Data feature to keep your own backups.</p>

  <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>

  <p>Cadent is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the app. Our total liability to you for any claim related to the app shall not exceed the amount you paid for the app (if any).</p>

  <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>

  <p>We may update these terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>

  <h2>Governing Law</h2>

  <p>These terms are governed by the laws of New South Wales, Australia.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>

  <p>If you have questions about these terms, contact us at <a href="mailto:your.email@gmail.com">your.email@gmail.com</a>.</p>
