  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 27, 2026</p>

  <p>Cadent ("we", "our", "the app") is a fitness tracking app that helps you set goals and monitor your workout progress. Your privacy matters to us. This policy explains what data we collect, why, and how we handle it.</p>

  <h2>Data We Collect</h2>

  <p><strong>Account information.</strong> When you create an account, we collect your email address and an encrypted password. If you sign in with Apple, we receive the name and email you choose to share. This is used solely for authentication and syncing your data across devices.</p>

  <p><strong>Workout data.</strong> The app stores workout information you log manually or import from Apple Health. This includes activity type, distance, duration, date, calories, heart rate, pace, and GPS route data. This data is yours — we use it only to provide the app's features.</p>

  <p><strong>Apple Health data.</strong> If you grant permission, Cadent reads workout sessions, heart rate, active energy burned, and distance data from Apple HealthKit. We only read this data — we never write to Apple Health. Health data is used exclusively within the app to display your workouts and calculate statistics. We do not sell, share, or use your Health data for advertising or analytics.</p>

  <h2>How We Store Your Data</h2>

  <p>Your data is stored in two places:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>On your device</strong> — workout and goal data is cached locally for fast access.</li>
    <li><strong>In the cloud</strong> — when you are signed in, your data is synced to a secure cloud database (hosted by Supabase) so it persists across devices and app reinstalls.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Data is transmitted over encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS). Your password is never stored in plain text.</p>

  <h2>Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not use analytics or tracking SDKs.</li>
    <li>We do not collect your location in the background. GPS route data is read from Apple Health only when you explicitly import a workout.</li>
    <li>We do not display advertising or share data with advertisers.</li>
    <li>We do not sell your personal data to anyone, for any reason.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

  <p>Cadent uses the following third-party services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Supabase</strong> — for user authentication and cloud data storage. <a href="https://supabase.com/privacy" target="_blank">Supabase Privacy Policy</a></li>
    <li><strong>Apple HealthKit</strong> — for reading workout data, with your explicit permission.</li>
    <li><strong>Sign in with Apple</strong> — as an optional authentication method.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Export and Deletion</h2>

  <p>You can export all your workout data as a CSV file at any time from Settings → Export Data.</p>

  <p>You can delete your account and all associated data from Settings → Delete Account. This permanently removes your data from both your device and our cloud database. This action cannot be undone.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

  <p>Cadent is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>

  <p>If you have questions about this policy, contact us at <a href="mailto:your.email@gmail.com">your.email@gmail.com</a>.</p>
